README -- Differential expression analysis
############################

	1 - Read in STAR Count Matrices. Performs differential expression analysis with DESEq2. Requires some visual inspection of graph outputs.
	2 - Read in all DESeq files from datasets with over 50 DEGs to create strip plot.
	3 - Reads from a folder of all DESeq files, creates a folder of top 3000 up- and down-regulated genes from each dataset for Jaccard plot.
